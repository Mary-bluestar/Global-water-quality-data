# Global-water-quality-data
Global water quality database, encompassing chlorophyll-a, LSWT (lake surface water temperature) et al.

Our water quality database encompasses 124,317 in-situ chlorophyll a (Chl a) sample records from 5,623 water quality monitoring sites across 50 countries on every continent except Antarctica. Additionally, the database includes data on LSWT (Lake Surface Water Temperature, â„ƒ), TP (Total Phosphorous, mg/L), TN (Total Nitrogen, mg/L), DO (Dissolved Oxygen, mg/L), and Secchi depth (m). Comprehensive location details (latitude, longitude, lake bottom elevation, country, and continent), morphological characteristics (e.g., lake surface area, mean water depth), and hydrological data (average discharge in m3/s, and residence time in days) are also compiled.
